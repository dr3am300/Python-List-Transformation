# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to master the art of slicing in Python lists.
# Problem Statement:
# You have a list of daily temperatures for a month, and you'd like to extract specific data from it.

# Task 1: Given the list of temperatures:

# temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]
# Extract the temperatures for the second week (7 days) of the month. Expected Outcome:

# 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,

temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]
second_week = temperatures[7:14]
print(second_week)

# Task 2: Extract all the temperatures above 100.

temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]
above_100 = temperatures[temperatures.index(101):]
print(above_100)


# Task 3: Reverse the list and extract temperatures from the 5th to the 10th day of the reversed list.

temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]
reversed_temperatures = temperatures[::-1]
print(reversed_temperatures[4:10])
